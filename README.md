# pandas_404 - AI-Driven Crop Disease Detection
Farmers worldwide have a crucial problem in detecting and combating crop illnesses early enough to avoid severe output loss. The reliance on human inspection restricts disease identification's scalability and accessibility, especially for small-scale farmers and those living in rural areas with little access to agricultural knowledge.
Proposed Solution: to create a website which takes input images from farmers of crops which will get passed to through an ML model to give if crop is diseased or not.
